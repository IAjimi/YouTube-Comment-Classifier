"Love you Pewdiepie don't apologize your fine",0,0
"I am seeing so much idiocy and lack of self awareness in these comments. Let me hit you all with some knowledge: the N word is not okay to say because it has body counts and a huge amount of human suffering attached to it. The word goes back to slave owning days, same as the N word with no hard r. Black folks can say the word because it is theirs to reclaim. I'm a person of color and that word is not in my vocabulary. Why? Because I'm not black, and I'm aware of the oppression tied to this word. I'm also not a piss baby arguing why I should be able to use such a gross word because again, this word is not mine to reclaim. So yeah, it's fine when all these black rappers use the word because it's a part of their personal history. As a grown ass woman I am still in disbelief that people can't have a pinch of empathy for their fellow human beings. If you're not black, you are irrelevant in the conversation of whether you can say the n word. You can't, bottom line, and if you're still arguing your right to say it, well then I have news for you: you're a racist.",0,0

"Other streamers do the same thing and don't apologize. Here is a prime example of a truly moral person he tries so hard even censors himself to try and be a good example but he makes one tiny mistake and they attack him.  I saw an example where a teachers writes the time tables for 9 he starts by writing 9x1=10 then writes the rest right. The kids make fun because he got one wrong but fail to acknowledge that the rest are correct it goes to show people will quickly make fun of your mistakes but ignore your accomplishments. Keep doing what you're doing pewds you truly are an inspiration",0,0

"I forgot that pewdiepie's fandom is a majority white people 😒.\n IF 👏 YOU'RE 👏 WHITE 👏 DONT 👏 TELL 👏 POC 👏 HOW 👏 THEY 👏 SHOULD 👏 FEEL 👏. Our ancestors paid for that word with their own blood, so poc today can use it how ever we want. You cannot tell us how we should feel. Y'all are disgusting for backing up your problematic fave and I'm pretty sure he did this before. Pewdiepie is canceled.",0,0
"And this could in all honestly become a good thing for you. You sit on a platform where you could really educate people especially when so many of your fans seem to think it's okay to be said. Really learn about the history of the word and come back to us if you can because you could really help educate people and that's powerful.",1,0
"What the hell is wrong with everyone who's talking badly about him he said the word by accident it's ok pewdiepie you're super cool we all love you the people who are here and supporting you😊❤️",0,0
"OK guys i get that the word was once used as a demeaning term and that the history of that word will never change, yes pewds fucked up but still it quite obviously wasn't his intention to use the word in a racist way. And those people overreacting are making it easier for toxic media influencers  to fuck every single content creator because they are blowing this out of proportion, pewds is not a racist.",0,0
"pewdiepie had nothing to be sorry about.  everybody who is mad at him need to get their head out of their ass and get over themselves.  or maybe when a black person makes an offensive remark about a white person i should call them racist and see how they like it.  turn about is fair play.",0,0
"I think other YouTube's who are hatting at him are just jealous that he is bigger than them. I think yes it was wronge for him to say it but common give this guy a break ok I have heard this word said by black people daily if they can say it why can't white people why so sensitive. I am Indian and have heard Sooo much rasisum from every body including black and white people. This is outrageous I am pissed and not happy u can clearly see he was hyped up at the time when he said this can't u actually just support him and understand that he is a human as well",0,0

"Y'all will forgive him for anything lol",0,0
"i think its funny how he said one word and all of the sudden its the end of the world i get it words hurt but you all need to grow up honestly because i can say this the fact that you get offended by a word is dissapointing like seriously theres so much worse one youtube but no one does anything about that grow up!! and at least he had the decency to own up to what you did he said this to everyone in the entire world lets you get on camara and apologize infront of millions of people i bet you cant do it..",0,0

"To the people saying that since black people say it why does it matter if another race says it this is one of many reasons why our society is shit now. It doesn't matter if black says it that doesn't justify other groups using the term shit like that doesn't just slip out that's the worst word you can think of ? It's scary how dumb a lot of people are in these comments we've got a lot of work to do America. Some of your reasoning validation his reasoning for using the word is ridiculous. #SMD",0,0

So, please , people on the comments, stop saying it's just a word or I feel offended for them . Let them say what they think about what happened.",0,0

"As a Black American, I don't think it's that big of a deal. I haven't even seen the clip but from what I've heard and from what I know about Pewds from watching him for years, I can conclude it wasn't meant to be offensive. Lots of the time the word is used now (or its variants), it's not meant to be racist or worth getting offended over. Although, I don't get why people have this weird obsession with saying it. While context does matter, regardless, it's a word with a shitty history and unnecessary to use. When people have a fixation with the word it weirds me out and makes me think they're closet racists. Do people think it's edgy or something? (I'm talking primarily about nigger, not nigga because that word has a totally different connotation)",0,0
"Saying Nigga isn't even bad it's only bad if you say it in a hateful way to black people ALL THE CRY BABIES and immature people stop going at him I guarantee youse you wouldn't say it to idubbz or others but because it's pewdiepie you think you have the right to go full force at him Yet I can see were people are coming from because pewdiepie did start the biggest ad crisis on any platform ever he has to much pressure on  him that's my speech down 😂😂 btw I do like idubbz it was just an example",0,0

"Poods, irrespective of your intentions (which I genuinely believe are pure and not hateful), you are a public face and voice and what you say and do influences others greatly. It's really disappointing to see that you still struggle to really respect the influence you have on YouTube and to your 57 million audience.

As an newly subscriber and a fan, I didn't see the bit your apologizing for on your channel but heard the douchebag Sargon of Akkad (not a fan) mentioned it on his channel, where he's clearly stating that it's more then ok to use that particular word if one is not a racist and actually said it multiple times. You clarly have more integrity and a higher moral character then he has and as a Albanien-Swed, am verry proud of you for apologizing. Big UP Brah!",0,0

"I defended pewds the last racist thing he did. Pewds isn't racist, that's just his inappropriate, dark humor. There's no need to be sensitive, but if you're accidentally racist on several occasions it's not an accident and you're actually racist. I've never ever said the n word, because from a white person that's a terribly hurtful word, and with the black family members that I have, I would never want my young cousins to hear the word that came out of this mans mouth, especially since he's an influencer. Now I'm going to be hearing it more, and then hear well pewdiepie said it, so can I. It's not okay, and it's not something you say in the heat of the moment, it only slips out if you frequently say it. I think I gotta give up on defending this. I've been subscribed for like 6 years. And it's time to say farewell.",0,0

Anyway, the thing is many many parents take a an opportunity to peek and even take pictures of our room when clearly someone is in the room!  Please don't open or peak into other people's room! or even try to open closed room! It is common for us to leave our doors slightly open for other dormmates to come by and say hi to hang out! We don't mind if you are in the hallway, but if you push the door like a creep and take a picture? We have a problem. Also, we know for sure that the tour guys have warned to not open our doors or peak inside because they know 1/50 parents do this and out of many tour guys are our own dormmates.",1,0

And my heart goes out to all the victims and will continue to support. But it is so sad to find out that tragic events like this can be man made at times. So I pray that many of you become aware of what's really taking place in this reality and give your life to God, he won't disappoint you. \nAnd I pray that this whole event about helping is not just an agenda to promote and push coexistence, globalism and unity. Their religion of occult  New Age/mysticism and rise of their Antichrist/alien god to bring their New World Order, which they believe, chaos must be created in order to bring Order. Where with their mind witch powers and advance alien/demon technology they can create  almost anything they can imagine. \nDon't get me wrong please, helping is awesome as I'm praying for everyone including the celebrities participating and even those who have sold their souls for riches and fame, is not to late for redemption! I'm praying for you. But really hope this is not all orchestrated for a different agenda, don't forget that the road to hell is paved with good intentions. Time to read our Bibles and take a close look at  the book of Revelation chapter 13,  Daniel 12 and Luke 21.\nStay strong Texas, Florida, all the Caribbean and to all those affected. May you find peace and joy in Christ Jesus even in the middle of the struggles. Remember man and Satan  can only hurt the physical body or the material but can't never have our souls if we believe we are Gods children and the only way to be redeemed and adopted into Gods family is by Jesus Christ our Savior, there's no short cuts and Satan is a liar so don't fall for the lies because religion kills and condemns the soul, only a true relationship with Father God through Jesus saves.

"Hello, I am Theresa Williams After being in relationship with Anderson for years, he broke up with me, I did everything possible to bring him back but all was in vain, I wanted him back so much because of the love I have for him, I begged him with everything, I made promises but he refused. I explained my problem to my friend and she suggested that I should rather contact a spell caster that could help me cast a spell to bring him back but I am the type that never believed in spell, I had no choice than to try it, I mailed the spell caster, and he told me there was no problem that everything will be okay before three days, that my ex will return to me before three days, he cast the spell and surprisingly in the second day, it was around 4 pm. My ex called me, I was so surprised, I answered the call and all he said was that he was so sorry for everything that happened that he wanted me to return to him, that he loves me so much. I was so happy and went to him that was how we started living together happily again. Since then, I have made promise that anybody I know that have a relationship problem, I would be of help to such person by referring him or her to the only real and powerful spell caster who helped me with my own problem.

"Whenever a magician needs to touch something, that's usually where the magic occurs. Unfortunately for Colin, the camera angle right before he asks Heidi to say stop reveals a white item cupped in his right hand (this is of course the magical list of 3 items - Rome/Cheese/Ellen - about to be pressed onto the printed paper wherever she says stop). To see this white item, you'll have to watch the DVR version of the TV broadcast as this internet version has been edited by AGT to remove this reveal. At 03:06, Colin brings this small piece of paper from his right pocket with his right hand. It's all actually a simple slight-of-hand trick performed with far more flair and advance video preparation than wily subterfuge.\n\nAlways be suspicious when a magician needs to touch something with any part of their body or any device they are holding. That's usually where the magic happens.",0,0

"I thought this was a good offering from Apple. It will be a well-executed device and likely be a big winner, sales wise (despite the price) even if they're just now catching up in some areas.  \n\nImpressed by:\n-chipset. They were already beating all competition here with the 7. Bench numbers look amazing and every day performance will likely follow suit. \n\n-software: photo options, UI with no home button looks super easy to adapt to\n\n-4K@60 and slomo. Damn tech is getting impressive across the board here. \n\n-fit and finish and presentation. The package is pleasing to me overall. I don't mind the notch at all. \n\nI was a bit disappointed by a few things:\n\n-screen brightness. Boo! \n-no promotion/120hz refresh\n-fuck 2x optical zoom. Samsung and Apple, get your shit together and give me something more useful here. \n\nI've owned both Apple and various android-based devices. In general, I find Apple to hold up better (lag less) and simply be a more fluid and enjoyable experience. Less buggy, more mainstream/supported and compatible with apps like e.g DJIgo4, etc. \n\nI'll probably wait for the next iteration of this one, but I like it. \n\nWhy has no mentioned the absence of the blush gold color option. That was a winner in my book, but not even a whisper? No one seems to be talking about it, especially after all the leaks.",0,0

"How can people be excited about this crap? This makes absolutelly NO sense at all. First: Most catastrophes are not caused by overpopulation, but natural disasters. Even if you make the point of carrying capacity in terms of food becoming a problem, it could be tackled by GMOs easier and better. Second: You CAN NOT just shrink people down like this. The size of nucleons are unalterable, because the ranges of the strong and weak nuclear forces are fundamental constants. Reducing the space between nuclei and electrons is impossible because of electromagnetism. And even packing molecules tighter together wouldn't work, as there'd be biochemical problems. Correct protein folding and therefore enzymes would be rendered impossible. Third: How could they metabolize food and drinks not their own size? Their tiny enzymes wouldn't work on normal-sized molecules. I'd say if you can alter the fundamental universal constants, carrying capacity is no worry any longer, you're basically beyond even a kardashev III civilization by then. \n\nThis isn't even original, as some say. The shrinking trope has been done to death!\nAnd before someone points out this is supposed to be a comedy: Even a comedy needs suspension of disbelief. Also, it may be because I hate Hollywood comedy to the death, but at least for me they're always the same. Clichee-filled crude humor fests with plots of idiocy. And this looks exactly like that.",0,0

As bad as Sheriff Arpaio was, and I think his deliberate malfeasance killed people, he wasn't in the same league as Mr. Rivera.  Among other felonies, he was the head bombmaker for a terror group, the FALN, that claimed credit for 120 bomb attacks, killing six and injuring dozens.  There are parallels: as with Sheriff Arpaio, Mr. Rivera was unrepentant and as with President Trump's pardon, President Obama's commutation was popular with a slice of his constituency.",0,0

"Radiohead ha estrenado un nuevo videoclip para su canción “Lift“, uno de los temas inéditos incluidos en el lanzamiento de OKNOTOK, la reedición de Ok Computer por su vigésimo aniversario, que se puso a la venta en junio. Se trata de una de las canciones que quedaron guardadas cuando la banda británica estaba componiendo uno de los álbumes más influyentes de su carrera: El OK Computer (1997).\nDos décadas después, el tema vio la luz en OKNOTOK. La reedición incluye el disco original, las 8 caras b y tres temas inéditos que el grupo ha tocado en directo pero cuyas versiones de estudio jamás han visto la luz. Estas son “Man of War” y “I Promise“ y Lift, todas ya con su correspondiente nuevo vídeoclip.\nLas imágenes de Lift están dirigidas por el británico Oscar Hudson, que ha trabajado con la banda desde el lanzamiento de A Moon Shaped Pool (2016). En este vídeoclip vemos un surrealista viaje en ascensor protagonizado por el vocalista del grupo, Thom Yorke.  En el trayecto se encuentra con diversos personajes y situaciones, pero como se indica en la canción, no todo es lo que parece.\nMúsica independiente novedades.",0,0

"I know train isn't really popular in the US, but I highly doubt that electric planes will be in concurrence with trains in Europe. Distances here are really shorter and the major advantage of train stations is that as they were pretty much all built in the late 1800's/early 1900's at the periphery of cities, they are now the heart of the cities. You get down the train and you are immediately where you need to be (most of the times with a lot of easy public transportations). Take Paris for example : its 4 majors train stations are all in the middle of the city while you need at least 30 more minutes to get back from airports to the centre (not even counting the checks and everything). That being said, even if we laugh a lot about it, train transportation is very developped and popular here in France, with high-quality high speed railways and a great local network and there might be a hole to fill in other countries, especially in the US with congested traffic",0,0

"I disagree that the B757 is showing age, the 767 flew before it and it's still in high transatlantic use. Plus they're fuel efficient, so there's no need. If airlines are still flying 747s across the pond which is 20yrs older, that means 757/767 still have at least 25yrs left in them. How about Boeing just create a NEO project for the 757? Quieter and even more fuel efficient, especially with those really loud Rolls Royce versions, but then again I love engine noise, I miss that at the airport. The NOISE, the smoke trails from DC9s, 727s and 737-200s. Eventually airlines and all transportation industries are gonna have to search for alternative energy sources, its inevitable.

But a supersonic flight, even if one had been available (it wasn't), wouldn't have cost *a little extra* but probably would have been *twice* as expensive, and I couldn't afford that.\n\nIf we want supersonic airliners, luxurious airliners, gigantic airliners, we need to get wages up.

When taking into account that the train is _considerably_ more comfortable (more leg room, free to walk around at all times, no changing transportation three times, no long waits, ) I just don't see air travel ever beating the rail unless it gets considerably cheaper (which probably won't happen, since any advantage in electric transport that improves ticket prices for planes is bound to also improve them for trains ).",0,0

"I highly doubt electrification is achievable for flight (at anything past prototype) and even if it was it's doubtful it would be cheaper than avgas.

Using cheap clean nuclear power to create a carton neutral high energy density fuel (much higher than any battery by many factors) is a much better solution and a much more likely one.

"I have a couple issues with this video.\nThe question is not how much oil we have left but how much of it we may still burn.\nIf we keep drilling for and burning fossile oil at the same rate right now it will very soon let the effects of it, specifically global warming exponentionally worsen. It is true that we might have decades of fossile fuels left over, but we can’t ever burn that all if we would want to keep this planet an inhabitable home for many further generations.\n\nThe plane of the future in my subjective opinion is a zero-emission, perhaps solar-powered or at least “green” energy loaded aircraft with about the capacity of a rather small long-haul airliner and the range of this new Boeing 797 concept.\nBy 2030 already, we will have about 1,000,000,000 more people living on earth than now and this leads me to being concerned more about the regular medium to short-haul travel than a couple transatlantic flights.\nThere will be a point when our usual short to medium-haul airliners like the 737 will not be capable of running the routes they fly anymore because of capacity issues. More and more people are living on earth and the percentage of people using air traffic as their mean of transport is increasing just as quick.\nAirlines like Swiss, Austrian and British already use 777s and 767s for routes like Vienna - Frankfurt, Zurich - Vienna and London - Amsterdam. And that is only one of countless flights on these routes each day. If zero-emission aircraft don’t become a reality, running larger capacity, fuel efficient planes a couple less times a day rather than more low-capacity aircraft will over a long course perhaps be the better solution for our planet, air congestion, those affected by aircraft noise and so on and so forth. It may make us dispense with comfort in terms of frequency of flights and travel times, but I don’t think I have to elaborate that our earth is more valuable than arriving somewhere one hour earlier or later.",2,0

"-- Ezra Klein (3:14) Do you think that one of the lessons of watching Bernie Sanders, of watching Donald Trump, is that perhaps the correct role for policy in a campaign is to inspire? And that the place for technocratically sound, more pragmatic policy is in the legislative process? -- American politics centers on emotion, on charisma, on sensationalism. But it shouldn't. Voters shouldn't care about the color of a politician's toupee or pantsuit. What matters is process and, even more so, results, and the person (or, rather, team of people) managing that political process shouldn't be determined by a popularity contest. Without substantial electoral reform, voting directly for President of the United States will always, for most of the electorate, be tantamount to voting for a high school prom king.",0,0

"One year after the fact, and its amazing how much visceral hatred for Hillary still remains, and the extent to which it colours popular perception. She's written a book exploring what happened, which, no matter how you slice it, will mean looking at the reasons why she lost. Being able to reflect on that experience, mistakes and all - and learn from it is pretty important for anyone to be able to do. You won't get far in life if you can't do this. But slather this with kneejerk hatred and it suddenly becomes entirely a blame game! \n\nI mean, it takes a deep plunge into the the pit of 'alternative facts' to be able to watch this interview and come away with the conclusion that Hillary is simply doling out blame. And yet, here we are.\n\nI say this as an international observer - someone who hasn't been caught up with the hyper-partisanship and tribalism that is clearly afflicting many Americans - you guys need to take a step back and have a good look at yourselves and what you're becoming. What you've already become. When you can't tell fact from fiction at the most basic levels - when your prejudices are affecting your judgement to this extent, something has gone seriously wrong. And as alarming as this is - and it should be alarming to just about everyone - it appears like a huge segment of both media and laypeople (as evidenced in the comment section here) alike are clearly more interested in indulging in their hatred and self satisfied criticism, than giving any thought to the content of the discussion.",0,0

"One of Hillary's problems is that her positions on issues may have seemed more grounded, by they also didn't solve the problem. For example: When Sanders talked about public college being free (through a regulatory measure, similar to what is done in the UK), Hillary's proposal was tuition free college in which tax credits would be given to help subsidize the cost of college, but only for families below a certain income bracket. So you have tax money being used for college credits for certain people, which does nothing to actually curb the out-of-control costs of college education. All it does is give colleges an excuse to increase their tuition rates because now, the money would be coming from the government instead of students. \n\nAnother example: Universal Healthcare. Hillary said, 90% of people are covered, so it's easier to just get the other 10%. Maybe. But the 90% don't all have good, or affordable coverage. They're just covered. The plan of extending Obamacare further doesn't do anything to actually curb the out-of-control costs of healthcare, because her plan continued to see cooperation with the money-sucking insurance companies. See? There's a pattern here.",0,0

"I definitely think Hillary Clinton's viewpoint that the American people care about details, analyses, facts, and legislative precision was inaccurate. A large portion of both the primaries and the general election *is* a personality contest, whether we like to admit it or not. You need to learn to appeal to different crowds while still maintaining a focus on your agenda items.\n\nIt wasn't that Hillary didn't have that focus - I think she expended far too much energy in maintaining it, and not enough on figuring out what crowds wanted, or how to tailor her speeches so that both laypeople and those in-the-know would get a sense of who she was as a person and leader.\n\nThe end result of the loss can be blamed on the timing of a variety of events and the presence of a variety of scandals, real or imagined, but a large part of the responsibility lies with how she chose to run a data-centric, cold-and-clinical campaign. I hope future leaders learn from her missteps.\n\nAs for her commentary on Obama and her husband...I don't think they ran anywhere near as clinically as she believes. I do think they were more capable of being a visionary, of matching personalities with their opponents.",0,0

But I grew up before cell phones and the wide adoption of the web so I can see the difference. What about kids who are born today, into the age of the smartphone? I'm worried that they won't have the foresight or the will to be able to use self-discipline and abstinence before its to late.

"I've had a GSM in the 90's, hated it and never got a mobile phone again, smart or otherwise. What I have observed in the last 10 years is that smartphones narrow peoples perception of the world. Instead of the normal stereoscopic 120 degrees of vision, people condition themselves to be focused on barely 5 degrees of screen in front of them. This generates a whole slew of awkward problems. It generates anti-social behavior and I hate the smart phone concept for that.\n\nThis video was especially entertaining because it sounded like Johnny Ives from apple..",0,0

"Its not the technology, but the way people use it. A phone can be used to shoot a video for a project or to create music with creativity, or even draw a picture, which creates a platform to express yourself that anyone can access.

"I think Gwyneth Paltrow is pretty hot, like most straight guys probably do, but to promote her BS lifestyle magazine / whatever is reprehensible. GOOP basically takes advantage of misinformed people, that spend money they don't have to buy things they don't need, don't work, may be harmful, and are overpriced, because they somehow trust Paltrow for advice. Some examples of snake oil scams promoted recently by the magazine: 1. Wellness stickers from NASA that were publicly discredited by NASA, which confirmed the product has no technology developed by NASA in it. 2. Yoni Jade Eggs, which women are supposed to put inside their vaginas, which in the words of OB-GYN Dr. Gunter could be a risk factor for bacterial vaginosis or even the potentially deadly toxic shock syndrome; and 3. Vaginal Steaming which doctors also call a load of garbage. Just to name a few. They have been repeatedly knocked for false advertising, misleading advertising, and settled lawsuits out of court. It is truly horrifying to see CBS promoting this garbage. I hope CBS is named in future lawsuits that are sure to come as people are injured and/or simply realize they were duped by Paltrow and GOOP.",0,0

"that moment when you accidentally type the declaration of independence:\n\nThe unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.\n\nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.\n\nHe has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.\n\nHe has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.\n\nHe has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.\n\nHe has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.\n\nHe has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.\n\nHe has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.\n\nHe has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.\n\nHe has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.\n\nHe has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.\n\nHe has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.\n\nHe has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.\n\nHe has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.\n\nHe has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:\n\nFor Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:\n\nFor protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:\n\nFor cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:\n\nFor imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:\n\nFor depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:\n\nFor transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences\n\nFor abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:\n\nFor taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:\n\nFor suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.\n\nHe has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.\n\nHe has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.\n\nHe is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.\n\nHe has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.\n\nHe has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.\n\nIn every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.\n\nNor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.\n\nWe, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.",0,0

Annnnnnd they already knew of super powered beings from the hulk having existed well before iron man 1, ant man existed, and captain America existed (and was frozen unbeknownst) so they had an idea to find super powered beings around the world and get them on the side of good knowing that the odds that all super beings being friendly is super low. They then went out in search from the start of iron man until the avengers creating a superbeing archive of names and people that were super powered to decide if they are good or bad and then create a fail safe using the good super beings. Then Loki strikes and Thor comes and that's when nick fury reaches out to all those archived super heroes to create the avengers in said movie.",0,0

"This no-name bitch is feeling 'sad' for Jim Carrey.. How thick-skulled can a reporter be?

"He legit is the only sane one there....and her saying she's sad for him is the saddest thing ever...these corrupt lowlife self-contained robots are the downfall of this world and because this man actually sees life for what it's really worth their going to make him look insane....they need to look at the monsters they've become...hypnotizing a generation into being stuck up judgemental snobs....shame on them for doing that to our youth....the message Jim Carrey just sent out live to the world is what needs to be known ....we're all energy ..they want you to see black white yellow brown....he doesn't see that and neither should the rest of us....we're all the same in the end",0,0

"Dude what the fuck. E news didn't show all of it. Jim Carrey doesn't have a twisted relationship with fame. Jim Carrey (somewhere along the way) humbled himself and realized that the world doesn't revolve around money, fame, and the spotlight. There's more to life than Hollywood and I'm actually with Jim on this shit. It doesn't matter, not a fucking bit. Psychedelics may or may not have been involved in his thought process but at least he's not a scientologist.",0,0

"Hey Lady if by talking seriously  you mean talking about clothes, shoes and gossip then you shouldn't interview people as Jim Carrey. You have two different levels of consciousness and yours is pretty low. All I see in this video is a very intelligent and spiritual man talking to an ignorant woman who cares only about the surface. He should have looked at you the way you've looked at him. But the world's crazy and unfortunately people like you are considered the 'normal ones' and the ones like Jim Carrey are the 'freaks'.

Might i suggest you all squeegee your third eye and realize that ego is a mental delusion, that's what he meant by there is no me. Personality like Celebrity is an abstract, what are we without our names, jobs, social status, etc? A bunch of tetrahedrons A.K.A atoms. That's it. We're star stuff as Carl Sagan put it.",1,0

"He's talking about awareness. He's talking about Advaita, non-dualism, Lila, Tandava, cosmic unfolding. Whichever name you want to give it. Sounds like he's annoyed at the materialism of Hollywood and his mandatory role in these sorts of events. Also sounds like he's having a bit of fun while having to go through the whole rigmarole.

And you look at him and talk about him like he a weird crazy man just because he doesn't feed you the predetermined bullshit about clothes that you expected. Fuck E news, Fuck this reporter and Fuck anything else that suppresses free thought. Love Jim Carey for doing this. He's so intelligent in comparison to the people who surround him that they think he's the deluded one. it's nuts",1,0
"Jim Carrey is RIGHT, u self obsessed, shallow morons. You’re  just unenlightened And in light of losing someone he loves to suicide.....do YOU really matter? NO !!! No, you do not. But you know what matters even less than you? Is fashion. Or what u think is in and fashionable. Don't u know there is an entire world out here that see you all as foolish, laughable and quite silly.",1,0
"Jim Carney is brilliant, He's woken up to the truth about Hollywood and how fake they all are and what their priorities and agenda is , it is all meaningless cause you can't take fashion or mansions or your money with you when you die,  when have you ever seen a Uhaul truck in the back of a hearse ? He's more focused on deeper things now like real life , how we are all one than what is the hottest fashion trend that will die off in a year anyway , He gets it now and Hollywood can't handle it , Don't feel sorry for Jim , feel sorry for those in Hollywood getting sucked into the non sense . Jim is sharper than ever",2,0
"Not dissing Carey but it sums up Hollyweird.  A fake industry of social climbers filled with fruits and nuts.

I am hoping for a small difference in your videos though, i am not a content creator so i have zero idea what it would mean monetarily wise but if possible this is my hope. I love the idea and the locations and diversity of the food experiences etc you know what you do, but what i always find myself wanting more of is a bit of you and your partners in crime experiencing a little more of the locales than going straight to the eateries. Not to get all patriotic but Melbourne has been voted most livable city in the world 7 times running, i would have loved to have seen just a little more of you guys experiencing the location as i love your personalities before going straight to shots of happy eating faces. I know its the premise of the show but it seems such an effort to travel so far and not show any footage of you enjoying the actual location as well as the food.

Parcellls always said he's smart. But many could not see that. Well, now anyone who appreciates smart football will see for themselves. Here's the downside: now I probably need to get GameRewind because he's calling games in the AFC and I think it's brilliant the way he anticipates the action, so if I wanna see that I'll have to pay for it.

I saw it opening day and enjoyed so much more than I expected so I've wanted to talk about it a lot more, and you talking about it makes it feel like a conversation with a good friend ^_^\nAfter thinking about it, I theorize that Pennywise is either unable to hurt/kill a child unless they are afraid (or maybe they're just tastier when he's built up fear in them, like fear is the marinade and the longer they soak in it, the more satisfying, because I mean, he attacked Georgie no problem, but maybe he was like ehhh needs more fear) oooorrrr he's just a total egomaniac like most villains and decides that his prey must acknowledge how frightening he is to boost his self esteem or idk, maybe he wasn't hugged enough as a wee alien monster clownie.",0,0

"it was said in an effort to let richie know that he went too far.

"In the book, the whole point of Pennywise in his clown guise was to lure kids in by appearing harmless fun and goofy. The first part of the novel takes place in 1957, decades before the whole ironic creepy clown trope was a thing. Although creepy clowns have always been around, it wasn't as prevelant back then. A clown was still a credible disguise. \nBy moving the setting up 30 years, you make Pennywise's modus operendi rather dubious.

I set the bixpy app to factory reset which would be its state before i activated it, and now every so often within a longer interval of seconds the phone will wake itself up as if im pressing the power button. This even happens when i shut it down and its charging, i dont press the button yet the screen will wake up to show the percentage when its off or go to the screen before you unlock the phone while its on.

"not sure if this video is purposely misleading or not, but from what I've learned Spartan heiresses inherited half, to less than half, of that which was divided among male children. Spartan heiresses could not determine who they married. It was arranged by some sort of guardian or ruling body, not by themselves. Once married, a Spartan heiress' inheritance would be granted to the control of her husband - the catch is, he would most likely be at war, training for war, or investing himself in politics, far too busy to run household business. \n\nHowever Athenian scholars have suggested that it was Spartan women who contributed to the demise of Sparta herself. As inheritance grew, so did entitlement, and women married later and later, sometimes choosing to not have children at all. To a diminishing Sparta outnumbered (as I've heard) up to 10-to-1, this was a death knoll. Lack innovation. Lack of conscription. Xenophobia. Fear of trade. Women who the Greeks considered overly entitled and outright unruly, thus slowing, if not halting all together the supply of Spartan stock... everything was a powder keg. \n\nBegrudgingly, Spartans had to eventually let Helots join their military ranks just to fill the gaps. And then... there were nearly as many helot warriors trained up as Spartans as their were Spartan citizens. A unique, but over all failure of a government strategy. Yes they created the first constitution. Yes the practiced oligarchy, democracy, aristocracy and duoarchy at the same time - kinda reminds me of the States. Yes the Spartan government lasted longer than Athenian democracy (also a huge failure). But No, no, no, could Sparta sustain itself. It did good for like, what, 400 years? But little room for growth or upward mobility. Shame.",0,0

"the spartans had slaves that allowed the entire population to live like aristocracy and devote their time to war. We have so much technology that much of what is needed to run a society is done my machines overseen by a few people.

"The Spartan decline is due to the Thebans under Epaminondas freeing the helots of messania from their captive state. The Thebans decisively defeated the spartans at the battle of Leuctra, and marched on into their heartlands. While not being able to conquer Sparta itself, Epaminondas moved into Messenia and freed the helots there. This was a third of Sparta's land, and about half of the helot population. To make sure the Messenians would remain a free people he rebuild the city of Messene, and with it build some of the strongest fortifications in all of Greece.\n\nWhile Epaminondas died a few years later and Thebe as a major power with him, the Spartans never recovered from this defeat. It meant that the Spartans could no longer field there entire male population as an army, for the simple reason that there were not enough helots to feed and supply them. It was also a huge moral defeat, as both the Spartans as the rest of the Greeks no longer saw the Spartan army as invincible. It has to be remembered that the massive loss of land counts for much as well. For example the 'heiresses' could no longer uphold their wealth if a third of their land or more was suddenly no longer in their possesion. This meant that not only did the spartans lose their ability to field a massive army, they also lost the power to fund it.\n\nWhile this does not completely account for the MASSIVE loss in influence and manpower, it  was without a doubt the start of the decline. It was probably, as you said, that they were not willing to change their ways after losing half of their helot/worker population",0,0

"Wasn't there a class of non-citizen freemen who lived in the Spartan lands? If I remember correctly they mainly did the jobs that were seen as above the Helots but beneath the Spartans proper, such as a good deal of the merchant work, as well as serving in the army if called upon. In fact if my memory of my undergraduate reading doesn't fail me it was actually possible for these freemen to be elevated into full Spartanhood under very special conditions and with the support of a Spartan citizen.",0,0

"22:20 \n\nI think you answered you own question in this video. Because Sparta raised it's soldiers from men who owned plots of land provided by the government, the less land owners the less soldiers. And because over centuries these lands accumulated to wealthy families it meant there was less public land to distribute and less soldiers to raise.\n\nThey couldn't alter the course of this accumulation of wealth because of the conservative nature of the government. \n\nPretty similar to what happened to Rome. Strong army in the beginning by giving it's male citizens plots of land and raising them into an army but then the wealth accumulated and the armies weakened. \n\nI quess it's difficult to avoid that phenomena of accumulating wealth and through that power to a small part of the population because those who could stop this are the ones benefitting. So basically the greed of a few made these empires collapse.\n\nMaybe this tells something about what happens when you can inherit great wealth. Wealth accumulates and along that power. Then the government that was supposed to look after the nation is primarily concerned with their personal wealth.\n\nWhat could've the government done? Well nothing really. If even a considerable portion them would've wanted a reform to distribute public lands again it would've required majority. If the king wanted it he would've basically needed the other king to murder the elders together to make it happen. And even then what is the backlash to such an action? Civil war would be highly likely. The two kings would have to enforce their laws by force. And what after? Would they reinstitute the same system or work as 2 kings. The 2 king system is definitely ending with a civil war or an assassination to form a dictatorship. \n\nSo it doesn't really seem like there was any other course that this form of government was going to go through with that structure.",0,0

I think that those were interesting points to be considered: a geographical power whose only strength was it's military capabilities having said capabilities cut short led to an eventual downfall, that the pride and lack of reforms made sure to continue.\n\nLastly, archaic freaks or achaean-c freaks?

"1. Great looking, sense of humor, snappy dresser, likes to dance.  Worst that could happen: He's gay, and dating your ex-boyfriend, who you turned gay.\n2. Stable job, good income. Seems to like puns, has a mechanical pencil collection, and names his socks (after Dark Horse comic book characters). Owns an Atari 2600 and brags about it to strangers.  Worst that could happen: Engineer. And gay. And better than you.\n3. First time you met, he went in for the quick-hug, as if you were close friends. And then sniffed your hair. Although he doesn't stare at your chest, which is nice, he does stare at your feet. And said your toes are adorable.  Has a scraggly soul patch. Second-worst that could happen: He is confusing you for a girl he saw on Chaturbate. Actual worst that could happen: You are the girl he saw on Chaturbate.\n4.  You keep running into him at improbable places and times. He acts like he doesn't see you, but gets nervous and runs away when you call him out. You are suspicious that he is a stalker. Worst that could happen: it turns out he's not a stalker, and those were just coincidences. Now you're bummed because you feel like maybe you aren't good enough to stalk.\n5. He has a popular YouTube channel. You think it involves cats. Or cooking. Or cooking for cats. Whatever it is, he has a warehouse full of something called merch, which you think may be some sort of narcotic. Possibly for cats. He brags about his subs and says that he is way more interesting than a Pootie-Pie, whatever the f*ck that means. Worst that could happen: you end up being a groupie for team 10.",1,1

Next, show the deck ( except for the one that is flipped over) and say pick a card. When they take a card, say memorize it. When they are memorizing it flip the deck over. Than say put the card anywhere in the deck. Once they have done that, say let me work my magic. So turn around and search the deck and you will see that it is the only one that is face up. Than put that card on the top of the deck, and make sure that it is facing the same direction as the rest. Take it off of the deck, show the card to them, and say, was this your card?

Let us look at the describtion:\n>>Nihilism (/ˈnaɪ.ɪlɪzəm/ or /ˈniː.ɪlɪzəm/; from the Latin nihil, nothing) is a philosophical doctrine that suggests the lack of belief in one or more reputedly meaningful aspects of life. Most commonly, nihilism is presented in the form of existential nihilism, which argues that life is without objective meaning, purpose, or intrinsic value.[1] Moral nihilists assert that there is no inherent morality, and that accepted moral values are abstractly contrived. Nihilism may also take epistemological, ontological, or metaphysical forms, meaning respectively that, in some aspect, knowledge is not possible, or reality does not actually exist.<<\n\nImagine if you had a relatively normal human being, with access to infinite time lines of infinite universes with infinite possibilities while also being one of the smartest beeings in the universe - Rick often displays something, that could be seen as almost limitless knowledge. He is simply a character that has no limitations and is aware of it. A Narcissistic personality is a disorder which manifests itself already in a very young age. Rick on the other hand, simply decided to not give a shit.\n\nI like one theory that states that RIck is simply a character - the only character- that knows that he is actually a cartoon character. Now if that would be true, it would be really a way of breaking the 4th wall.",1,0

I experience a few of these on and off occasionally and im ok with dealing with them a lot but when I'm worse especially when I'm panicked in a situation I can't get out of I get more physical things like painful pins and needles around my face and neck and the feeling like my skin crawling, what feels like really violent shivers down my spine,  is this a form of depersonalisation or just a physical manifestation of panic? I've always just called it depersonalisation because it seems like it would be but idk, I've always been curious.\n\nI'd like to try more types therapy though, I want to go back to talk therapy as it helped me a lot, especially with bigger things?  but I don't know if other things are worth trying more for the long term.

This video was very informative and super accurate, good job girls 👏🏻💕 I still felt hopeless after watching this, like I always do when it comes to dissociation. I just feel like there is no cure for this. Nothing ever works. I feel like I will never feel alive again and I will never get back the contact to myself that I once lost.

I went to go talk to a psychologist, but I don't know how to be verbal about my issues bc idk what's wrong. I am soooo confused with how I feel and my parents won't take me to a psychiatrist bc they don't want me on meds. Bc they think that they won't help bc my mom said she took them when she was a child and they made her feel disconnected from the world. But it affects everyone differently. But they don't understand. My mom says it's part of being a teenager and it's all in my head. And idk what to do. Omg I didn't think it was normal to feel this way when you're a teenager but my mom seems to have all the answers. And it drive me fucking mad.

"Okay so this is no way me trying to get sympathy, because I am doing very well mentally. This is mainly out of curiosity. So, summer 2016 I was really really I'll, basically I was in and out of hospital for a month, I had three surgeries and basically lost a lot of weight. Anyway, I went back to school four days after getting out of hospital (only for like an hour a day) and it definitely tired me out a lot. Basically what I'm trying to say is that during my recovery time I'd feel a lot of things described in the video. It wasn't constant (like it is for Dodie) but a lot of the time I'd feel like I was almost in a dream, and nothing really felt real. I wasn't too worried as it didn't happen for long periods at a time and it didn't happen lots. Also my memory of when I was ill is quite foggy and I can't pinpoint specific moments. So, I was wondering if you can get derealisation that only lasts for a short time. Because once I got better it stopped happening. I'm fine now so don't worry, I'm just curious if that's what it was as I'm trying to learn more about mental health illnesses so I can be more helpful to friends who might go through these thing.",0,0
"i don't know what type of dissociation i suffer from but i believe it's some type of mix between derealisation and depersonalisation. when i experience it (which is quite often) it feels like a different world in my head. it's basically like i'm writing a book/a whole different universe every time i experience it. it is a continuous story but when i get tired of it or when somehow i start writing a new world the older one doesn't feel right anymore and it stresses me out to force myself to continue with the older one. everybody in my universe (i believe that they're called paracosmos in the literature world) has their own set story and life and thoughts and i can project myself onto any of them and live as them and that's how i deal with my real life issues - i make up some storyline that somehow makes my character feel in a similar way to the way i'm feeling irl and deal with it by not being myself per say. some characters are reoccurring since i was 14 (i have experienced this since i was 12 but i recall moments when i was 7/8 of very similar situations) and others die with the paracosmos i leave behind (i still remember them and their lives and all of that jazz, and sometimes i bring them back) (characters can stay alive but i change parts of their storyline and you know i make sure they fit into whatever world i picture). it is mostly triggered and stimulated by audio and visuals and when i watch a movie or a tv show and a character from those really speak to certain parts of me i almost always make sure to include parts of them in my paracosmos (i don't know if i'm expressing myself correctly). i also feel very attached and connected to them. i do lose keep track of time and sometimes space when i experience this and i do have gaps in memory because of this. i also have a really weird sense of time like it still feels like 2012 in my head (i was 12 at the time). i also experience this involuntarily when i'm in a not so positive mood and have lots of stress and anxiety or when i'm sad and all that jazz. when i'm happy it cools down a bit and i can sort of choose when to write it? like i know that if i listen to music when i'm happy i will dissociate and i know that if i'm walking by myself i will also do it etc. aside from this when i'm living in the real world i do experience feeling like i'm out of my body and i'm not inside of it (specially in social situations and when i have to interact with people) it feels like i'm in a movie you know? there's a lot more stuff that goes around this thing but i feel like i've written too much so i'm going to keep it to myself. also sorry if there are any mistakes i'm not a native english speaker x",0,0
"Hey, I wanted to share my story if anyone is listening so uhm yeah if you want to read it you can, I just wanted to since I've never talked about it before\n\n\nSo since I was born my mother has had depression, anxiety and severe OCD. Not the clean kind of OCD, the hoarding. So for 12 years I live in copious amounts of trash and filth, and of course I was never allowed friends over. I was constantly verbally abused by her but I never really understood what that meant at the time. It got so bad I had to share a bedroom with my dad, brother and me. Thankfully my dad and brother moved out to a house next door that we previously rented. It's still too ugly and mouldy to ever invite friends (I've never had a birthday party) but I'm so so thankful that I actually get to move around my house and freely enter any room without being bombarded with trash... Sorry if this is tmi I've just never told this to anyone, not even my counsellor. I'm 13 years old now and it still really affects my day to day life. I've never been diagnosed with anything but I have self harmed and had one suicide attempt. I constantly feel pessimistic about my future. I get good grades, but I'm extremely anti social. I'm scared I'm going to develop Asperges, a genetic mental disorder my mum carries. My uncle has it and because of it I've never met him, same with my grandma.

"I'm not gonna say I have this stuff, but I tend to have episodes where everything feels like a dream and very distant. For a while I would have small moments of depersonalization, and during school years, I would have up to almost a month at a time or at least most of a week I will/would just have empty busy times. In those times I just go through life without thinking and barely remember what happens when I come out of it. I get really touchy a lot and I have a friend who used to physically latch onto people and when she did that to me, I got stressed and had that distant feeling and that feeling usually meant in a few days I would have those empty periods of time.\nI don't know, though. Just don't attack me, because I'm only saying I have similar experiences and am very paranoid and idk why, but I'm not going to diagnose myself.",1,0

Last year, when I was at school, I just felt like I was floating through a dream that never ended. Youtube has helped me feel those emotions again and all of the sudden the feelings would go away! Something about school triggers it, but I don't know what. With depersonalization, I often, since I was very little, have felt disconnected with my body. I would look at my hands and feel weird, and try stomping my feet to make me feel connected, but nothing would work. I just felt like I was floating separate from my body. Eventually, it would pass, and I never thought much of it. Now, I can put a name to it and try to tell people how I feel!

(His name was JESUS!!!)......\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n(Christ Witnesses to Nicodemus on the reason why people want to stay in their sins and not accept him as their Lord and savior and as believers, you have to produce works to show that you have saving faith in God. (Matthew 3:8)<---Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance.):\n\nAnd this is the condemnation,\nthat light is come into the world,\nand men loved darkness rather than light,\nbecause their deeds were evil.\n\n(Condemnation): Refers to the reason for judgment. The light referred to here is Jesus, the light of the world).\n\nFor every one that doeth evil \nhateth the light,\nneither cometh to the light, \nlest his deeds should be exposed.\n\n(People offer many excuses for not accepting Christ. Some cite the presence of hypocrites in the church. Others claim inability to believe some of the truths about Christ or the gospel. These are merely attempts to conceal a heart in rebellion against God. The ultimate reason people do not come to Christ is that they do not want to).\n\nBut he that doeth truth \ncometh to the light, \nthat his deeds may be made manifest, \nthat they are done in God.\n\n(The one who does the truth, (1 John 1:5)<---This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all), is obviously, already a believer because his or her deeds are done in God. Therefore, coming to the light is more than exercising faith. A person who comes to the light not only believes, but also openly identifies with the light so that his or her works can be seen as things done in union with God. (Jame 2:14)<---What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him? (James 2:24)<---Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only. (James 2:26)<---For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also).\n\n(John 3:19-21).",0,1

"BEFORE I GET A MILLION COMMENTS ABOUT IT, YES I KNOW THE FOUNDATION DOESN'T MATCH! It looked really great in the beginning but obviously oxidized to be WAYYYY to dark by the end of the video.

"I'm getting annoyed that people think just because Fenty foundation is water base and also per Riri doesn't oxidized; assume it's not going to oxidized . Foundation does get darker. Doesn't matter what situation .  What plays in is the person's skin type, how their bodies natural PH levels on the skin reacts to the formula , how much humidity is in the air, what products they put on before hand can cause a small chemical reaction to the foundation. Just because one is selling out doesn't mean it will work for you and your body chemistry.  There's a basic science to it . I hate how almost everyone in the makeup community thinks they are gurus ; yet don't know that hooded eyes can't have the same cat eye wing angle as almond shape eyes. Or something as simple as foundation . Unless you are certified in the field or know the chemistry behind it, please don't deem a product horrible if it doesn't work for you .Also if a product does work for you , doesn't mean the person who had a harder time with it doesn't know what they are doing . Simply means it's not for them . \n       Sincerely a makeup enthusiast.",0,0

So where did all these people die at and did they drown or get hurt. I don't want to see your video because it is a bunch of lies if you claim that 1,000's of people died in Florida - THAT IS A LIE - TOTAL LIE - 1000's are not dead!",1,0

Coming from Saint Augustine with FSDB, it's a more deaf-friendly city. I would imagine it's rarer to find signing hearing people in other areas. \n\nIt should be obvious that he was uncomfortable, so I instantly felt he must have been asked to interpret because of a lack of a certified interpreter under the circumstances. I have found myself in non-televised interpreting situations before that were too big for my britches. I would have been mortified if they were recorded. Please give him a break - he did his best, & it's a tough, high pressure situation to be in, especially on the spot. Let's not overlook the fact that he's serving in other ways, too, which is more than most can say at the moment. Give people a break - we all could use them sometimes.\n\n It may not have been ideal, but really people, a hurricane just went through our state. We've got bigger problems at the moment, & fortunately closed captions. Fortunately this was not a true *emergency* message (as far as I could tell), even though I know it must be isolating to the hard of hearing to be excluded from any message/update. So instead of spending our time pointing fingers, why don't we all just learn some sign language instead?",1,0

"First off, it is unfortunate that the local FEMA representatives responsible for emergency operations AND the local municipal government failed to have a qualified resource available to interpret, it seems to me that the problem is more of educating THEM on the importance of having qualified interpreting resources.  People sometimes think that when someone says:  Oh, I know sign language they are qualified to interpret (maybe all they know is finger spelling!  I give them credit for at least attempting to have someone there versus not having anyone at all.  This is of NO FAULT of Marshall's and he clearly did not state he was an interpreter in the first place.  Too many things happening in too short of a time for a critical natural disaster such as hurricane Harvey and hurricane Irma do not always allow organizations sufficient time to plan these things at the last minute -- that's why they should have agreements in place and interpreters included in ALL Emergency Management plans.  Don't trash the person who at least attempted to help, trash the people who don't understand they could have caused more damage than good by not having a qualified interpreter available.",1,0

Spoken language is difficult enough for the human mind to grasp; how meaning can be conveyed with these crude signals as rapidly as speech is tough to believe.

It conveyed the intended meaning BUT it was later judged 'racist' and it was changed.  My Gawd.",1,3

I seriously wanna get into the details of ur work and knw more abt this video.. Like ur cameras/the seaexpedition/how u go into tat cargo ship... Evrything i wanna know frm scratch.... Not bcauz i wanna take pics/videos BUT EMBARK ON TAT JOURNEY... This my biggest dream..#SeaFarer...and there is a huge person relation of mine with this beautiful mystic miraculous mesmerizing sea... Inshort itz like this: Unlike mine and my father's generation my ancestors are true fishermen and sea farers... By birth and growth i belong to fishermen Jati...but vth modernity and development creeping in... I can no longer associate to tat Identity of my ancestors vhr my father works in an insurance sector and i one foot in academics and the other carving my own path of career...  All tat remains is jus to fascinate abt it... But still my ancestor's blood flows in me and no wonder i just love those moments vhn i take a walk on those sandy beaches of the ocean / rocky terrains of river beds/ lakebeds.... That sight at those pristine waters in its all blue... Tat gushing moisturised wind bathing my face and blowing my hair...JUST LOVE TAT...even now i stare at tat vision vth the wonder and curiosity of a child... Its like i am completely zapped by tat moment... Only on these occasions i love for the person i am and thngs i do...as i feel tat nothingness vhn i face a sea and tat innocence of a child like creeps into me... Those waves of water itz just like purging me.. The rest of the time i jus shun thyself...  So i immensely love boat rides... Seas.. Oceans...as of now my love and passion for this is only allowed and encouraged to those tiny 15-20mins boat rides/long walks near the lakes... But vhn my responsibilities r ovr...SeaFaring is all i yearn.... Awww man luk at those thousands of stars and tat beautiful play of colours on the night sky and tat music of water waves... Those highs and lows of the waves approaching the ship... The carefree drifting clouds... Those gentle/rough winds... Those rainwaters... And tat eternal like silence.... My existence is reduced to a tiny speck of dot in front of this beautiful creation... I feel so little and humbled... Wish ppl around me understand this",0,0

That is one of the best YouTube videos I have seen in years. It does make you feel a bit small and insignificant when you put the world's oceans in perspective. I think this helps people understand the vastness of the water on this plant. I am afraid that people forget about the importance of the oceans until they make the news. On the other hand people will say there is so much ocean why should we be concerned. The night shots were beautiful. I would find myself standing out at night craning my neck to watch the universe go by. \n\nThough I have to say one of the thoughts that kept coming to mind was:  does it get lonely being out at sea for so long? What is the longest you have spent at sea during one stretch? How do you keep busy when not on shift? One stupid question does the ship ever become empty of containers? I actually have about a thousand other questions but that will do for now. Last thing please post more this was wonderful. I have watched it three times so far.",0,0

Which means he was writing about 12 year old children having sex, in great detail... he actually planned that shit in advance. \n\nI wonder how many other famous pop culture icons are secretly pedos and  serial kilers.

"some people seem to assume that this guy is making these facial expressions out of humor during  very traumatic time. Exaggerated facial expressions are forms of grammar necessary in Sign Language to make sure those who need it understand the severity of the situation. It may seem funny to us but its fairly common for this to be done. I think its awesome and I can totally see the humor and if people take that, thats cool but understand this isn't being done to mock or joke about the situation. He is doing his job as best as he could and I feel he did it brilliantly.",36,3
"To all viewers who do not know American Sign Language:I am deaf and use American Sign Language (ASL). This guy is doing a fantastic job of interpreting for the deaf! His facial adverbs equate with the spoken inflection and gravity of the emergency situation. Hurricane Irma is a serious threat and it cannot be taken lightly. This certified deaf interpreter just conveyed that.",7,0
"His facial expressions enhanced his explaining.....I thought he explained this dam good.",5,0
"He's a Cerified deaf interpreter (CDI). He does not hear the noises he's making. How it works is a hearing interpreter sits in front of the deaf interpreter and signs what is being said. The Deaf interpreter then interprets that into American Sign Language. Deaf interpreters are used because a native user/speaker of a language can convey the meaning clearer than a non-native native signer. Deaf interpreters are the best choice in a emergency situation (and many other situations) to meet the communication needs of the entire Deaf Community. There are different dialects of sign language. This interpreter interpreted the information in a way that any deaf person can understand...which is the point.",30,5

"You should probably amend that to Gov Rick Scott gives a warning with ASL (American Sign Language) interpreter, emphasizing the seriousness the situation for the deaf/hard of hearing audience.  There IS a difference - putting deaf first implies that the interpreter cannot hear, which is obviously false since he is listening to Gov Scott and interpreting into signs.\n\nEdited to add:  I saw Pam's comment. I stand corrected.",3,2

"He is the real deal and he is good.  He is a CDI.  I recently took a workshop he taught. To the untrained eye, his facial expressions are funny or weird.  But to native signers, those facial expressions are the most important part of the language.  They are the equivalent of vocal tone and punctuation.  Interpreting students have to learn these facial expressions.  It takes months -> years to learn this.  You want funny, you should see a class of new interpreters practicing facial expressions.  Also, there is a lot of work here.  The speaker, the off camera interpreter (who can hear) signing to him, so he can interpret the msg. and sign it in ASL. W/O facial expressions he's like a monotone speaker who says uh every other word.  Chinese sounds funny to me too, but that's because I don't know the language.",0,1

"Is the tongue really necessary",1,2
"I am deaf. His expression is not funny, it is the expression of seriousness of the hurricane and he is signing in true ASL that covers all levels of communication of the deaf. There are level of communication that come within the culture where there are spectrum of deaf level of understanding. It appears whoever post this lacks understanding of the deaf culture and it's situation. I assume you are hearing and do understand that you see only the expression and not it's signs that are visual and representable to the context of the language and situation that is happening that could save the lives of the deaf community.

"In Poland (and probbably in most other countries) it is common to save your spot by putting a shirt or a coat, an umbrella or a bag. Yet you should not leave any valuables (also in said bag) as they might get stolen. Also, the things that you leave still do not grant you that you will keep that seat as others may relocate your stuff to a different free spot that may not be as great as the previous one (views for example).",0,0
"In my part of the world , they have a saying : \n Gear adrift is a gift .... \n\nAnything left laying about will go missing almost immediately . \n\nYou are careful about showing valuable items when using them ... someone might rob you . \nEspecially high-dollar items like expensive watches , jewelry , cellphones , laptops , etc . \n\nYou never leave children unattended , as kids come up missing all the time . \nHeck , adults get kidnapped and held for ransom or murdered here . \nDrug cartel members have gun-battles on the streets . \n\n You keep a close eye on everyone around you . \n\nI have thwarted a couple of robberies simply by being aware and prepared . \nAvoiding being caught in what was an obvious set-up . \n\nScammers , thieves and robbers are a simple fact of life . \nYou watch for them like you would dangerous animals  , or poisonous spiders and snakes when out in the wilderness . \nThe wilderness is actually safer , and I spend a good bit of time out there . \n\nI've had tools and things stolen out of the back of my truck , and my house broken into . \n\nYou have to lock everything , all the time . \nI can't imagine living somewhere so urbane . \nTo us it seems careless . \n\nAnd no , you don't get to reserve a seat before you order . \nYou order , then find a place to sit , if alone . \nIf you are with someone , they hold a spot , with your gear , while you order for everyone . \nEven then , you watch out for each other . \n\nTrouble can start at any moment when you are out in public . \nYou have to be ready to grab your gear , and fight your way to safety , at any time . \nCertain groups thrive on causing trouble , it's entertainment for them . \nYour gear becomes their gear , if you lay it down , or they can take it from you .",0,0

No.\nEven if the Japanese were 100% trustworthy- and they are not, there are millions of foreign tourists there every year. Just because Japan is extremely safe doesn't mean it is 100% safe.\nLiving there for years, I became aware of some incidents of theft. However, I will always say that Japan is a great place to travel solo, as crime is extremely minimal. You can use backpacks or bags behind you without any real fear if being ripped off. You don't have to worry about someone rummaging in your bags while you get your wallet to pay. If you ask someone for directions, or look at a map, or otherwise be distracted, you are extremely unlikely to be taken advantage of. But you're still not 100% safe. Don't tempt fate.",0,0

"I have a good tuna salad & some other ideas... I am just hoping this helps someone. I'm sure there's a TON of people on here who have family in FL, I know I do. My tuna salad goes great on any kind of cracker, bread, in a tomato, lettuce, or wrap. Especially for people trying to stretch a meal while packing in a lot of vitamins or just use up veggies. The majority of these things will last out of the fridge and even though there is quite a bit of prep, it's totally worth it. You can even just throw all of it on a sandwich in a pinch and get the same flavor. \n\nI came up with this about a year ago when my husband and I were down on our luck and I was trying to pack a bunch of nutrition, & bulk into an affordable meal.\n\nAnyways, I normally use 2-3 cans of tuna, if you only have 1 can, just use that! I've done it before, and it still worked perfectly. My cats usually get part of the can. It's also another way to feed your pets if you need to. Lol So I hit the drained tuna immediately with the juice of 1 lemon. If you don't have lemon, use red wine or some other kind of vinegar. Then add 1/2 - 1Chopped red onion, 1 chopped green bell pepper, 1 seeded chopped tomato or a handful of cherry/grape tomatoes, both sweet & kosher dill pickles chopped, or relish, S&P everything and add a touch of mayo. You could even omit the Mayo if you wanted. The veggies and the lemon juice add enough moisture which cuts back on the amount of mayo needed. The acid from the lemon cuts through the fishyness as well. I have also added celery to this and have topped it with provolone. Could be a great vegg friendly item for people who don't like to eat tuna.\n\nAnother great idea with tuna and or leftover pasta. You can always make tuna salad for 1 day or meal, then make a pasta salad the next. If you cooked a couple days prior to your power being knocked out, it's possible that you already have cooked pasta. If you have frozen peas, add those in with a simple tuna salad made with something along the lines of tuna, lemon juice and zest or vinegar, red onion, and dill weed, or dill pickles. It's another way to stretch something you've already made or use up something you have already. \nThis pasta salad can go so many different directions. You could do a Greek or Italian style, cold/room temp pasta salad with different cheeses, deli meats and veggies. Adding things like spinach to bulk it up. If you add cheese, you should eat it asap obviously.\nYou could even do a veggie wrap with peanut sauce...",0,1

"It's interesting that you brought that up Hank, because that's pretty much exactly what's been in my head upon meeting you on Sunday.  I'm not sure that you remember me, but I was the Asian girl in the red beanie, the blue hair, I had a face full of makeup, puffy jumper and healed boots. Now already, I can feel the judgement/ analysis of the type of person you (the reader) think that I am... And that's okay, because it's human nature. It protects you from imminent danger and whatnot. The way I presented myself that day is not exactly what you would call the 'typical nerdfighter' image. It makes me wonder how different your perception of me would have been if I had my glasses on, I'd worn a hoody, and I'd come up to you barefaced (and here I am stereotyping the typical geek or nerd -.- see we all do it). Don't get me wrong Hank, you were lovely, but when you looked at me for the first time it was a look of suprise almost. Idk maybe that's just how I read it. It suddenly kicked in that you had no idea who I was, yet I knew so much about you (your personality, your likes and dislikes, your hobbies, your intellect, your status etc etc) and I can only imagine how hard it would be to be meeting all these strangers, hundreds in a row, and being nice to them and trying to make them feel welcome. I realised that your perception of me would be purely based upon this 60 second time frame. (In which those 60 seconds I freaked out, ran up and hugged you, acted like a complete fangirl and said exactly the things I had decided not to say to u when waiting in the line haha). But I feel as if we have this programming inside our minds that automatically works to act a certain way towards people depending on the type of person we perceive them to be or by how safe we feel in their presence. Its not a bad thing. It's just human nature and it protects us. But man, on the other hand, this is exactly the reason why some people are so self conscious and so insecure about what they look like (I know I definitely struggle with that on the regular.. Because I WANT to dress how I want, i want to be able to have fun with what I wear and make up my face so that if u made a collage of my face each day, it would be like a fluid mosaic) We can't stop the judgement, because it is innate, but we can go into meeting a new person with an open mind. I just think its an interesting topic...but I mean, socialising is harddd. Probability of u reading this: probably zero. But worth a shot anyway :)",0,0

"My annual summer marathon of Vlogbrother videos once again comes to an end...in September. Yeah, there's a lot of these now. \n\nStill good though! Although there's a lot of death in the later years, I must say. I mean, the videos are also much, MUCH more positive and optimistic overall and about the future as we go along but there's also a lot more discussion on mortality and growing older, as well as actual death (both good news, like how less people are dying now which is great and also the many horrible ways in which living things are dying...and Lemon).\n\nI think the channel is still great and perhaps more importantly, still greatly loved. The Green Brothers may be older, John may be greyer and Hank may have a sexy haircut now but it seems like they are happier and better people than they were at the start of the project and so too are we. \n\nI feel like Nerdfighteria needs a poem, like the Sherlock Fandom does, to encapsulate the wonder of it all, y'know? 221B is a great poem for the latter series and fandom. We need one too.",0,0

"Well if there is 14 watermelons in the pyramid, you need to realize that they are 75% water, so, given that information, we can use the circumference of each melon (which is about 34 inches) to calculate the volume of each melon. 75% of that is water, and 25% is less dense fruit. Now, our calculations may vary based on formulas, but once you get the weight of one melon you should be home free. All you have to do now is multiply what you got by 14 and you get the total weight of the watermelon pyramid. Pls read on to compare your results with mine.\n\nMy estimates put the TOTAL weight of the watermelons at about 6 trillion pounds plus or minus a few.",0,0

And anyone with a brain knows that voting for this guy would mean controlled opposition and the anti-White bias going even more through the roof it broke through long ago. He wouldn't bite the hand that feeds him, his own tribe I you know that much. He would overtax working class and ultimately keep the ridiculous power imbalances the same or make them worse. The worst thing he would have done is open immigration as a genocidal divide and rule and Europeans as the eternal scapegoat. He would likely recruit directly from antifa and BLM for supreme court and other critical institutions. His own Black campaign Spokeswoman came on CNN and outrageously shouted a sarcastic boohoo poor White people at an old man getting dragged out of his car and beaten only for supposedly voting Trump. And then they are surprised these people DID vote for Trump and call them stupid for doing so. When Blacks attack White people in the streets 24/7 without the politicized, monopolized, J$w run anti-White media or politicians giving a crap rather jumping on any opportunity to brand White people racist and persecute them as if responsible for all that strife.",0,0

": : I have an allergic reaction to anti-depressants so in order to sleep well I take gabapetin (seizure medicine) which doesn't effect hormone/chemical levels but more neurons to sleep well at night and reduce anxiety.

I'm so glad to see you getting better all the time and figuring things out with a great attitude. ;)\nThe only time I ever felt like I was going slow was when I had a high fever as a child and I was delirious too.

Exercise , yoga and you still need light amount of sun , look into tinctures herbal to detox , juicing and raw fruit and veggie diet and you will beat this in a month or two believe these words I speak they are poisoning you and do not continue if you wish to live , this advice is with love , if you love to live quit the chemo on all levels it's not your fault they have tricked and manipulated the population it's a money making , that's it all it is they have killed my family members and dine my research and saved others , look Up DR.ROBERT MORSE ON YOU TUBE HE WILL SAVE YOU YOUR DREAMS ARE TELLING YOU WHAT YOU FEEL INSIDE IS NOT RIGHT GOD BLESS YOU AND PLEASE HEADE THIS WARNING AND THIS ADVICE IT WILL SAVE YOUR LIFE , PEACE AND LOVE TO YOU PLEASE GOD SAID TO TELL YOU THAT THING YOU KEEP THINKING ABOUT ,THAT IS BOTHERING YOU , YOU ARE RIGHT COME ALIVE AND BELIEVE IN YOURSELF NOT YOU AND CHEMO CHEMO IS EVIL ,GOOD LUCK YOU HAVE A NEW  PLAN NOW START  NOW  PLEASE .....!!!!!!!",1,0
"PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DONT DO CHEMO OR RADIATION THE DOCTORS ARE WHAT THEY FIRST SUGGEST WHEN YOU HAVE CANCER WHEN THEY KNOW THE FRICKING TRUTH THEY WANT TO BELIEVE THAT IS THE SOLUTION WHEN THE SOLUTION IS THAT CANCER IS NOT AS BAD AS WE THINK WE CAN GET RID OF IT NATURALLY BY JUST CHANGING YOUR DIET ONLY VEGGIES AND FRUIT AND NOO MEAT AT ALL THATS IT I HOPE YOU READ MY COMMENT GOD BLESS YOU .",0,0
"chemo is mustard gas and was created by the Nazi's.  It's got a very low survival rate in 5 years, only about 9%.  There are holistic methods that have a much higher survival rate.  The medical industry does not want you to find out about natural therapies, b/c it's all about profits for them.  Look up the youtube video channel Chris Beat Cancer and find out the truth. Most doctors would not do chemo. If you look up info on youtube you will find that people cure cancer holistically. All cancers are due to toxins in the body.  The mainstream medical system is clueless. You need a naturapathic M.D. that can do vitamin B17 and Vitamin C IVs.  Chemo is a toxic poison and you can't get rid of toxins in the body with another toxin. Ask your doctors what the cause of cancer is, they do not know.  But, naturapathic M.D.s do lab testing and know the cause of cancer is toxins.  Look at your food labels and wonder why there are chemicals in foods, where do you think that goes when you eat it.  There is a reason why the food and drug admin are working together.  Profits from poisoning the population, is big bucks.  You can get rid of cancer by detoxification using herb, essential oils, juice fasting etc. A Naturapthic doctor can help you. Look up Dr. Robert Morse on youtube.",0,0
"I'm glad you're doing ok. However I just wanted to mention that chemotherapy does not work. 97% of the time patients taking chemotherapy do not get better and they relapse. When a person has chemo inside their body they are killing all good living cells including healthy probiotics and bacteria that keep you functioning and that promote good digestion and other things. Chemotherapy is literally putting chemicals inside of your body to try and kill cancerous cells. If you want to read more about chemotherapy and the messed up medical industry I would really recommend you read The MD Emperor has no Clothes By Dr. Peter Glidden.",0,0

If I call with I seem clingly or will she be waiting for me, also if I did call first, I have the thought of will she remember me? Was she too drunk at the bar and gave me her number by accident? Thinking I was better than I was and being drunk only made me seem better than I was. \nI know I just need to have the courage to take that first step but because I have so many doubts and have been rejected so many times in the harshest ways before, how will I over come that fear of being rejected over and over?",0,0

It does not represent weather but only electrostatic anomalies which, conveniently for us, cannot be hidden. You can visit the COD home page and learn the process for accessing similar or other data from other Nexrad (Doppler radar) sites. You should note that this data is regularly scrubbed from the Intellicast system used by most meteorologists. Previously too many weather reporters struggled to explain these anomalies to the general public. HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN WEATHER MODIFICATION TO THE PUBLIC?",0,2

So he has him kept on as groundskeeper and after himself obtaining the Elder wand, might have fixed it.  More likely however it is as his discussion with Ollivander states...

"If Dumbledore was born in 1881, and the happening with Ariana was when Dumbledore just had finished his school (1898/99)– how is it possible, that the legendary battle between him and Grindelwald was in 1945 (Dude, that sentence...)\n\nReminder, after the sudden death of Ariana, Dumbledore struggled with himself around 5 years to fought Grindelwald, until the community literally forced him to. (Because he feared the chance, to find out, that he killed his own sister with his very own curse).\n\nSo, the battle must've been round about 1903/04. Or did I miscalculate?\n\nP.S.: Sry for my bad Grammar. My English sucks.. ^^",0,0
"It's also possible that Grindlewald loses mastery of the elder wand before the duel, or that Dumbledor knows a trick to defeating the master of the elder wand. After all, the invisibility cloak is another deathly hallow and supposedly completely hides its wearer, even from death, but Dumbledor knew exactly where he was. Dumbledor believes that these items, elder wand included, are not really what they are said to be, but simply very powerful magical items. Thus, the elder wand is not impossible to beat, just imbues its master with a lot more power, making them a lot harder to beat. Therefor, all Dumbledor need do is be clever about it and also be powerful himself by a wide enough margin to make-up the difference. He defeats Grindlewald, becomes the owner of the wand and fixes Hagrid's wand.",0,0

"Nice to see them continually evolving and growing. That's something that The Rev would have loved. He was always trying/doing new things and helped pushed them in a lot of new directions.  For the people complaining about this, this is what AV7X has always done. It's not all always metal. You haven't been paying attention if you're just realizing this now. Brooks Wackerman seems to be a big help in their continued growth. No disrespect to Arin Ilejay, a monster drummer who stepped in when they needed him most but I was worried it wouldn't last. His inexperience and lack of a broad musical background would make it hard.  Plus that was a very hard and trying time for Avenged. This too is probably part of the healing process.",0,0

"I prefer 1+-year-old cats over kittens.  Sure, kittens are cute, but older cats are more level and easier to train (*less* distracted).  Also, you should point-out the importance of teaching basic commands (sit,  stay, down).  Many people let their cats get away with little/no training without seeing the complete joy of having a properly-trained cat.\nNeither of my cats had issues with milk.  They never got a lot, but a tiny bowl one or twice a month was a special treat.  Fluffy (20) even liked a little melted ice cream…when we had room in the freezer.  Tony (14) just liked a little milk, especially when he'd try to steal it from my Coonhound, Lilly.  You could tell that it was a power issue because he NEVER did that with Sue (15), our late Heeler mix.",0,0

"Dear Simon's Cat friends. This is a public forum that kids looks at. Dropping F bombs arguing about cat food is ridiculous and juvenile. Remember, yours is just an opinion, not fact. Everyone is entitled to theirs. My cats are 14 ,15 and 17, are super healthy and have eaten Purina dry for half of their lives. Now they have Iams dry food. NO wet food. They have great teeth and seem really happy and playful. That works for me and them, but maybe not you. Be happy your pet is healthy and stick with what works for you. Try being nice to other people, and your pets will think you're pretty cool for acting like them.",0,0
"My cat would follow my mum around every morning meowing what sounded like milk until she gave it to him. It wasn't until he got older that he had trouble with milk. He couldn't tell rice milk apart from cow milk. Either that or he didn't care. Later both he and his sister lost the ability to digest any kind of cat treat. We still wanted to reward good behavior. They had no problems with their kibble. So I simply put some kibble in a separate container. When they earned a treat, I got some from the special container. They were just as excited as if it were something other than what they always eat. So presentation was all that mattered. Cheaper too.",0,0
